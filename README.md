##A nodejs FHIR REST Server
####Project goal: fast and simple implementation of [FHIR](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/) for HL7 Version 3.

Inspired by the OSEHRA [vista-novo-generated-fhir](https://github.com/OSEHRA/vista-novo-generated-fhir) project.

Relies heavily on a fork of jspears [mers](https://github.com/jspears/mers) Mongoose/REST module.
